The robot can identify barrier objects and have the ability to replace those objects from his destination. The project has included two DVD stepper motors that represent X and Y axis graphically and this mechanism helps to make two dimensional movements of the hand. (* followed 2wd vehicle differential mechanism for gear motors rotations )Its included two 12 v battery packs and each battery packs have 6 li-ion batteries that collected from scrapped laptop batteries.\nOverall project, its included two ARDUINO UNO boards, three L298N motor drivers, three servo motors, two IR sensor modules , two LDR sensor modules and two LEDsTwo LDR sensor modules and two LEDs help to manage processes between left and right Arduino uno boards with specific programmed scenario.\n\nFuture Enhancement :\n\n1. Add Battery Management System ( Laptop BMS Circuit )\n2. Add powerful stepper motor for Y axis\n3. Enhance this robot using image processing and camera module\n4. Hide the complexity of wiring";
